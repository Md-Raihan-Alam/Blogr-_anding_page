### Responsive website

--you can check up to with any mobile lowest with 280px as long
as you have updated browser and javascript enabled
--It has good responsive effect
--It will response with highest any px devices and lowest around 250px devices
--it has normal menu and good work of javascript

## My process

### Built with

--HTML5
--SASS
--JS

-Well I did not expect that css will be around 620 lines after I type all code using SASS framework SASS is awesome and for this project Javascript
work was not much that challenging

## What I have learned

--This is my third project working with SASS and I understand my problem about implementing media query. Hope it will be fixed in project
--I have good amount of practice with SAAS.
--There were some problem that I face , like the image became too big some times or too small. Scale was making code break sometimes, position
absolute sometimes break the whole media queary section.
